# Database Design and Integration with Flask

## Database Concepts

### What is a Database?
A database is a structured collection of data that allows you to:
- Store data persistently
- Query and retrieve data efficiently
- Maintain data integrity and relationships
- Handle concurrent access from multiple users

### Types of Databases

1. **Relational Databases (SQL)**
   - SQLite (great for development)
   - PostgreSQL
   - MySQL
   - SQL Server

2. **NoSQL Databases**
   - MongoDB
   - Redis
   - DynamoDB

## Database Design Process

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- Identify what data you need to store
- Understand relationships between data
- Consider performance requirements
- Plan for scalability

### 2. Conceptual Design
- Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling
- Identify entities (tables)
- Define relationships between entities
- Determine attributes for each entity

### 3. Logical Design
- Normalize your database schema
- Define primary and foreign keys
- Set up constraints and indexes

### 4. Physical Design
- Choose appropriate data types
- Optimize for performance
- Set up backup and recovery strategies

## Flask Database Integration

Flask commonly uses these tools:
- **SQLAlchemy**: Python SQL toolkit and ORM
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: Flask extension for SQLAlchemy
- **Flask-Migrate**: Database migration support

## Example: Blog Database Design

Let's design a simple blog database with these entities:
- Users (authors)
- Posts (blog articles)
- Comments (user feedback)
- Categories (post classification)

### Entity Relationships:
- User → Posts (One-to-Many)
- Post → Comments (One-to-Many)
- Category → Posts (One-to-Many)
- User → Comments (One-to-Many)

## Next Steps

We'll implement this database design in your Flask application with:
1. Database models using SQLAlchemy
2. Database initialization and migration
3. CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
4. Forms for data input
5. Templates to display data
