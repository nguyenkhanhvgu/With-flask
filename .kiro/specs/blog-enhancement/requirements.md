# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the existing Flask blog application with educational features that demonstrate advanced Flask framework concepts and best practices. The enhancement will focus on learning key Flask development patterns including blueprints, middleware, caching, testing, deployment, and advanced database operations while building practical features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Flask Application Architecture and Blueprints

**User Story:** As a Flask developer, I want to restructure the application using blueprints and proper architecture patterns, so that I can learn how to organize large Flask applications and understand modular design principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is restructured THEN it SHALL use Flask blueprints to separate concerns (auth, blog, admin, api)
2. WHEN blueprints are implemented THEN each SHALL have its own routes, templates, and static files organization
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL use an application factory pattern for better configuration management
4. WHEN blueprints are registered THEN they SHALL use proper URL prefixes and error handling
5. IF the application grows THEN the blueprint structure SHALL support easy addition of new modules

### Requirement 2: Advanced Database Operations and Migrations

**User Story:** As a Flask developer, I want to implement advanced database features and proper migration handling, so that I can learn SQLAlchemy advanced patterns and database management best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database models are enhanced THEN they SHALL include advanced relationships, indexes, and constraints
2. WHEN data changes occur THEN the system SHALL use Flask-Migrate for proper database versioning
3. WHEN queries are performed THEN they SHALL demonstrate lazy loading, eager loading, and query optimization
4. WHEN the application handles data THEN it SHALL implement database transactions and rollback mechanisms
5. IF database performance is needed THEN the system SHALL include database connection pooling and query profiling

### Requirement 3: Middleware, Request Processing, and Custom Decorators

**User Story:** As a Flask developer, I want to implement custom middleware and decorators, so that I can learn how Flask processes requests and how to create reusable functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL use custom middleware for logging, timing, and request validation
2. WHEN authentication is needed THEN custom decorators SHALL handle role-based access control
3. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN rate limiting middleware SHALL prevent abuse
4. WHEN errors occur THEN custom error handlers SHALL provide consistent error responses
5. IF request processing is needed THEN before_request and after_request hooks SHALL handle cross-cutting concerns

### Requirement 4: Caching and Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a Flask developer, I want to implement caching strategies and performance optimizations, so that I can learn how to build scalable Flask applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages are requested THEN the system SHALL implement Redis-based caching for frequently accessed content
2. WHEN database queries are expensive THEN query results SHALL be cached with appropriate expiration times
3. WHEN static content is served THEN the system SHALL implement proper HTTP caching headers
4. WHEN API responses are generated THEN they SHALL use response caching for improved performance
5. IF cache invalidation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide cache management and selective clearing

### Requirement 5: Testing Framework and Test-Driven Development

**User Story:** As a Flask developer, I want to implement comprehensive testing, so that I can learn testing best practices and ensure code quality in Flask applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are written THEN they SHALL cover unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests
2. WHEN the application is tested THEN it SHALL use pytest with Flask testing utilities and fixtures
3. WHEN database tests run THEN they SHALL use test databases and proper test data setup/teardown
4. WHEN API endpoints are tested THEN they SHALL include authentication, authorization, and error scenario testing
5. IF code coverage is measured THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 80% test coverage

### Requirement 6: API Development and Documentation

**User Story:** As a Flask developer, I want to enhance the REST API with proper documentation and advanced features, so that I can learn API development best practices and documentation tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN they SHALL use Flask-RESTful or similar for proper REST implementation
2. WHEN API documentation is needed THEN it SHALL use Flask-RESTX or Swagger for interactive documentation
3. WHEN API requests are processed THEN they SHALL include proper input validation and serialization
4. WHEN API responses are sent THEN they SHALL follow consistent formatting and include proper HTTP status codes
5. IF API versioning is needed THEN the system SHALL support multiple API versions with backward compatibility

### Requirement 7: Configuration Management and Deployment

**User Story:** As a Flask developer, I want to implement proper configuration management and deployment strategies, so that I can learn how to deploy Flask applications in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL use environment-based configuration for different deployment stages
2. WHEN secrets are managed THEN they SHALL be stored securely using environment variables or secret management
3. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL include Docker containerization and deployment scripts
4. WHEN logging is implemented THEN it SHALL use structured logging with different levels and outputs
5. IF monitoring is needed THEN the system SHALL include health checks, metrics collection, and error tracking

### Requirement 8: Real-time Features with WebSockets

**User Story:** As a Flask developer, I want to implement real-time features using WebSockets, so that I can learn how to build interactive applications with Flask-SocketIO.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with content THEN real-time notifications SHALL be sent using Flask-SocketIO
2. WHEN comments are posted THEN they SHALL appear instantly without page refresh for all connected users
3. WHEN users are online THEN the system SHALL show real-time user presence and activity status
4. WHEN chat features are used THEN they SHALL support real-time messaging between users
5. IF real-time updates are needed THEN the system SHALL handle connection management and room-based broadcasting
